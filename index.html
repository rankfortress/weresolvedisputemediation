	<p>
	Divorce is a complicated process that can be made even more difficult when you donâ€™t know what to do next. You may not know where to turn for help or how divorce mediation works. For this reason, you must educate yourself on the benefits of divorce mediation and consider using a mediator if your future ex-spouse does not want to go through with it as well.
	
	Divorce is a painful and difficult time for many people, but divorce mediation offers one way to avoid the pain of litigation. When spouses agree on their own terms during divorce mediation, they can focus on rebuilding their lives after divorce in peace rather than worrying about courtroom drama. By working with an experienced mediator , spouses can make decisions that work best for them and their children.
